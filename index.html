        The B.C.C. has been a club ever since 2023 when Harper was in Grade 4. The idea started from Harper's idea to create a club.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the same time, her best friend, Verlene Kang thought of a great idea. She thought of a island as a club island and a club mascot! This island, as members know, is Starfall Island. The club mascot is a cat because of thier bravery and sneakyness.
